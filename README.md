# CFMAR Lab - Physics-Informed Neural Networks for American Option/GMIB Variable Annuity Pricing

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are function approximators capable of utilizing known partial differential equations (PDEs) to generate a solution. Training data in the form of collocation points are generated along some $n$-dimensional domain (where $n \in N$) using a random sampling method, and the PINN attempts to produce a function whose PDE residuals are at or near zero for each collocation point. Initial and boundary conditions (I.C. and B.C.) are also set and enforced within the loss function, since without these conditions an infinite number of solutions would exist for a given PDE. Although PINNs can also incorporate gathered input data to better fit the approximated function, our methodology focuses purely on minimizing residuals and properly fitting I.C.s and B.C.s.  

## The American Option

We began this project by first utilizing a Crank-Nicolson finite difference method (FDM) and enforcing a maximum constraint within this scheme to act as a benchmark against our novel Physics-Informed Neural Network in pricing American Options. The functions used to visualize the FDM solution and the associated Free Boundary can be found in the American-Options folder under the Finite-Difference-Method.py file, while the implementation of the Physics-Informed Neural Network, as well as visualizations of the solution can be found in the same folder under the Physics-Informed-Neural-Network.py file. We also included a file under the name PINN-Error.py to determine the difference between a given PINN approximation and an exact solution. The PINN framework used to solve for the American Option premium was repurposed [1]
